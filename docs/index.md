# Internationalization Package Overview

Internationalization supports the design and development of applications that work in multiple cultures. The culture defines specific information for the number, date and time formats as well as the week and month names.

The Internationalization package provides methods for parsing and formatting dates and numbers using the [Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR)](http://cldr.unicode.org/) data.

The CLDR module provides locale information for the `dates` and `numbers` modules.    

The Date Parsing and Date Formatting modules provide methods for parsing and formatting dates.

The Number Parsing and Number Formatting modules provide methods for parsing and formatting of numbers.

The General Formatting module provides methods for placeholder and type independent formatting.
