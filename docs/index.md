# Internalization Package Overview

Internalization supports the design and development of applications that work in multiple cultures. The culture defines specific information for the number, date and time formats as well as the week and month names.

The Internalization package provides methods for parsing and formatting dates and numbers using the [Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR)](http://cldr.unicode.org/) data.

The CLDR module provides locale information for the `dates` and `numbers` modules.    

The Dates module provides methods for date parsing and date formatting.

The Number module provides methods for number parsing and number formatting.
